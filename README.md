# misis-2019

**Welcome to the Machine Learning part of the course!**

For the practical part we are going to use Google Colab. In order to be able to use it, please make sure you have a google account.

Please also note that python coding skills (with libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib) are required to be able to follow the practical part. We've prepared some material for you to get started. Please make sure to work through the following two notebooks before 30.10.2019:
 - [Introduction to python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HSE-LAMBDA/MLatMisis-2019/blob/master/Introduction/01-Welcome.ipynb)
 - [Introduction to numpy, pandas and matplotlib with the Titanic dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HSE-LAMBDA/MLatMisis-2019/blob/master/Introduction/02-Libraries.ipynb)
